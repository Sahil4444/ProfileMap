I use the Mapbox token to show the Map in the project.
In the 'profiles' section you can search and filter profiles as you want.
I also created an "Admin Dashboard":
    In that you can "edit" and "delete" existing profiles by cliking on 3 dots at right side of table.
    You can add new profile by clicking on "Add Profile" and then fill the complete form.
    You have to use online image / avatar url or you can use the below existing image url's:
        1. /ProfileMap/a1.jpg
        1. /ProfileMap/a2.jpg
        1. /ProfileMap/a3.jpg
        1. /ProfileMap/a4.jpg
        1. /ProfileMap/a5.jpg
        1. /ProfileMap/a6.jpg
        1. /ProfileMap/a7.jpg
        1. /ProfileMap/sahil.jpg
